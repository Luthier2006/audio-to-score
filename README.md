# Audio to Score

**Audio to Score** is a complete platform for **converting audio into musical scores with a high degree of coherence and realism**, respecting **tempo (BPM), sound, instrumentation, muscles, clefs, and real voices**.

The project was conceived as a **professional pipeline**, combining stem separation, musical analysis, rhythmic quantization, and the generation of editorial scores.
